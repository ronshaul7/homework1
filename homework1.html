            <h2> What Is Pitaya</h2>
            <p> A pitaya or pitahaya is the fruit of several different cactus species indigenous to the
                 region of southern Mexico and along the Pacific coasts of Guatemala, Costa Rica, and El Salvador.
                 The common name in English dragon fruit derives from the leather-like skin and scaly spikes on the fruit exterior. </p>

        <div class="card"> <img src="./images/2.jpg"/>  <p>Growing regions: All over the country, except for areas with extreme temperatures, hot or cold.  The cactus should be placed in a semi-shady area or in the northern part of the garden. </p></div>
